Apple Vision Pro reviews roundup: stunning potential with big trade-offs,Samuel Gibbs,"T
he first reviews of Apple’s Vision Pro headset, from publications with early access to the company’s attempt to create the next computing platform, talk of a big leap forward for face-mounted computers, for better or worse.
The US-only headset, 
first announced in June last year
, aims to move “spatial computing” beyond the limited mixed-reality offered by rivals from Meta, Microsoft and others. It is packed with cutting-edge technology including 3D cameras on the front to capture videos, the ability to blend the real and virtual worlds with hand and eye tracking, plus a display on the front that shows a simulacrum of the wearer’s eyes.
But at a cost of $3,499 (about £2,760) in the US it has a lot of work to do to convince consumers and developers alike that it can be anything other than a super-expensive niche toy for tech enthusiasts.
The Verge’s 
Nilay Patel
 called the Vision Pro an 
“astounding product”
 but one with a lot of big trade-offs, including messing up your hair each time you put it on:
“Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason – they represent a huge leap forward in display technology,” he wrote. “They also look generally incredible – sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for colour at the factory so they are also vibrant and colour-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are 
so
 small, but they work 
so
 well that they seem huge.”
But he said that while the passthrough view of the real world is the very best yet, “the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars.”
CNBC’s 
Todd Ha
selton
 was 
impressed
 by the hardware and experience:
“I loved watching movies with the headset. I lounged on my couch and put up a huge screen across the wall of my living room and watched an hour of Barbie and the two first episodes of Masters of the Air before the battery was at about 5%. Another night I watched Greyhound. I used the NBA app, which was updated to work on the Vision Pro, to stream four games at once, with the main game in the middle and others pinned to the sides. It’s wild,” he wrote.
But he encountered the dreaded app gap problem that plagues new devices. “The Vision Pro supports more than a million iPhone and iPad apps. But you need to search for each app individually and some of them aren’t available. Netflix and Spotify haven’t been shy about not supporting the Vision Pro, though you can easily access either using the browser. Still, there are lots of others that I couldn’t find: 1Password isn’t there, which made logging into some apps a bit of a pain. You won’t find Uber, DoorDash (but there’s GrubHub!) or Amazon. None of Google’s apps are here, including YouTube TV, though it works fine in the browser.
“Popular games like Diablo Immortal and Genshin Impact aren’t available. Facebook’s apps aren’t here, so no Instagram. These are just a few I noticed.”
The Wall Street Journal’s 
Joanna Stern
 
found
 the Vision Pro was actually good for getting work done, with virtual windows dotted across your view or replicating a Mac’s display, as long as you have other bits of hardware:
“There is a built-in virtual keyboard so you can type in thin air. But it will drive you mad for anything longer than a short message. And selecting smaller buttons with a pinch should be a carnival game. I started getting real work done once I paired the Vision Pro with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.
“I levelled up again by connecting my MacBook Pro, which let me write this review on a giant virtual monitor hovering over my desk.”
But was it heavy? “Oh yes. The metal and glass build gives it a premium look and a weighty feel. One included band has a top strap to lessen the face crush; the other wraps around your head like a comfy tube sock. The Light Seal (not a breed of sea mammal) acts as a cushion and light blocker. Mine is now covered with makeup.”
Weight is one of the reasons the headset has an external battery pack tethered to it by a cable, but even then 
Patel found
 the magnesium, carbon fibre and aluminium headset a daunting prospect:
“You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face.”
Mark Spoonauer
, of Tom’s Guide, 
found
 the battery pack to be one of the most annoying things:
“The aluminum battery on the Vision Pro always needs to be with you to use the headset, which is not great. So you’ll need to put it in your pocket while standing or next to you while sitting. It’s 12.4 ounces, which is heavier than an iPhone 15 Pro Max (7.8 ounces). And while the cord is long enough most of the time, if you’re really immersed in a game or other experience and you move suddenly, you could accidentally tug the battery off a table or couch on to the floor.”
He added: “I’m also not a fan of how the cord to the battery can sometimes get a bit tangled. A couple of times I had to disconnect the cable so it would straighten out.”
Cnet’s 
Scott Stein
 said the Vision Pro was 
“a stunning look at the future”
, including ones envisioned in sci-fi:
“Apple is also expecting the Vision Pro to be a place to see all your own life moments, reliving them like a scene out of Minority Report. I tried watching recorded ‘spatial videos’, which are 3D videos that I previously shot on an iPhone 15 Pro. I also played back 3D videos and photos recorded directly with Vision Pro, which has its own cameras.
“The photo and video quality in 3D isn’t as good as Apple’s stunning 180-degree immersive video format, not even close. But when expanded to a fuzzy-bordered viewing mode, it starts to feel like a replayed memory. I went back to the holidays, to the Museum of Natural History, to a hotpot dinner with a friend in San Francisco, to a snowball fight with my kid. I started to forget where I was and imagined I could just walk into the moment.”
Stein said the Vision Pro was the best wearable display he had ever put on, but still a tough sell in its current form.
“At its price, and with so few VisionOS apps at launch, the Vision Pro isn’t a device I’d recommend to any of my friends or family. If you’re in the immersive industry and can afford one then that’s another story. But for anyone else, I’d recommend you get a free demo at an Apple Store, marvel at its features and wait and see.”",Tue 30 Jan 2024 16.12 GMT,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/30/apple-vision-pro-reviews-roundup-stunning-potential-with-big-trade-offs
"Pixel 8 review: Google’s smaller, longer-lasting Android",Samuel Gibbs,"Google’s standard Pixel 8 gets a little smaller, faster and smarter, while lasting longer than the competition with seven years of updates.
The new Android costs £699 (€799/$699/A$1,199) – a £100 increase on last year’s model – but still undercuts the competition from Samsung and Apple, which cost about £800.
By shrinking a little compared with the outgoing model, the 
Pixel
 8 has become one of the few smaller premium phones available. The 6.2in 120Hz OLED screen is bright, crisp and smooth while still being large enough for apps and video. The rounded aluminium sides and curved glass back feel nice and are easy to hold.
The phone has the 
same upgraded 2D face unlock system
 as the Pixel 8 Pro, with a fast and good under-display fingerprint scanner. It has Google’s latest Tensor G3 chip, which performed great at day-to-day tasks and handled games easily. The battery lasts slightly longer than its predecessor at about 36 hours between charges. It takes about 80 minutes to charge fully using a 30W power adaptor (not included), hitting 50% in less than 30 minutes.

The big upgrade for the Pixel phones this year is the promise of seven years of Android and security updates, meaning they will be safe to use 
until at least October 2030
. Few others offers as long, bringing Google up to par with Apple’s iPhones – with only Fairphone providing longer at 
10 years of support
. Extended support means you can keep the phone longer and its resale value for the second- and third-hand market will probably be much higher.
Google has packed the Pixel 8 with many of its new generative AI features including various image and video editing tools, new abilities for its voice assistant and more promised in updates in the near future. For more on the Magic Editor and other features, please see the 
Pixel 8 Pro review
.
The Pixel 8 has the same 
excellent main camera as the 8 Pro
, which includes a 2x optical zoom using the centre of the sensor. It is a big upgrade on predecessors, offering better low-light performance and faster, sharper shots. The 12MP ultra-wide camera is also solid and now used for a fun macrophotography mode for closeup shots of objects.
The Pixel 8 also gets most of the same generative AI tools as the 8 Pro including Best Take, Magic Editor and Audio Magic Eraser. But it lacks full manual control in the camera app and some more advanced features.
Overall, the Pixel 8’s camera is one of the best on the market but the lack of an optical zoom lens is disappointing.
Google does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable 
by Google
 and 
third-party shops
, with genuine replacement parts to be available 
from iFixit
 soon. Out-of-warranty screen replacements from Google cost £66 and batteries £36.
The Pixel 8 is made with at least 18% recycled materials, including aluminium, plastic and tin. The company breaks down the 
phone’s environmental impact

recycle old devices
 free of charge.

The Pixel 8 is not quite the same smashing bargain its predecessors once were – that honour is now the realm of the 
Pixel 7a
 – but it still offers a lot of phone for the money.
The fit, finish and feel is top notch. The phone is responsive and smooth. The battery life is decent. The main camera is excellent but the lack of an extended optical zoom is slightly disappointing, even if it has been a similar formula for Google for several years.
The 6.2in screen moves the Pixel 8 closer to the underserved market of smaller but top-end phones, of which there are only a handful to choose from. Google’s generative AI features are certainly novel, but it is the extended seven-year software support that truly sets it apart.

Sonos Move 2 review: serious quality sound with twice the battery life,Samuel Gibbs,"Sonos’s top-class battery-powered wifi and 
Bluetooth
 speaker has been given an all-round upgrade with double the battery life, impressive stereo sound and new touch controls.
The Move 2 is certainly not your average portable speaker. It costs £449 (€499/$449/A$799) and aims to be the only sound system you need for indoor and outdoor use, weighing 3kg and sized about the same as a traditional bookshelf speaker.
In essence it is the same as its stablemate the 
Era 100
 but with a battery on the bottom so it can be moved from room to room, out into the garden or taken in a car. Like the 
original from 2020
, the Sonos blows away practically every rival that isn’t a giant boom box once you crank up the tunes, and even tops its mains-powered sibling.
The outside of the Move 2 looks similar to its predecessor and is equally drop, water, dust, sun and cold resistant. It connects to a router via wifi 6 for streaming music from more than 100 different services, including Spotify and BBC Sounds, all controlled from the 
Sonos
 app on a phone.
The speaker automatically goes to sleep when away from its charging dock; press the power button on the back to wake it. Another button on the back turns on Bluetooth for use away from home or for streaming music from guests’ phones. Sonos sells plug-in ethernet or analogue line-in adapters for the USB-C port for even greater flexibility, if wifi or Bluetooth isn’t enough. A physical switch can disable the mics for the voice assistant and automatic tuning, too.

 
Dimensions:
 241 x 160 x 127mm

 
Weigh:
 3kg

 
Connectivity:
 wifi 6, Bluetooth 5, USB-C, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect

 
Battery:
 44Wh (24 hours playback), 120 hours standby, three hours to charge

 
Charging:
 Included dock or USB-C 45W

 
Water resistance:
 IP56 (dust and high-pressure water jets)


The curved grille hides a set of stereo tweeters and a large central woofer to give it real power and thumping bass. The Move 2 produces really good, wide sound with a decent stereo effect when facing straight on to it that quickly merges together when you move off centre. It has oodles of bass and power when required, supported by detailed highs and nicely defined mids. Vocal clarity is particularly good, even when the track has a pounding bassline, balancing power and nuance excellently.
Nothing ends up being overridden, too shrill or sharp, which certainly can’t be said for most portable speakers. An equaliser in the Sonos app allows you to fine tune the bass, treble and “loudness” to your liking, though the speaker automatically tunes itself to your space as you move it around.
It sounds best at about the 40-50% volume mark, with the bass starting to be clipped a little when cranked up beyond 70-80%, which is certainly loud enough for most rooms. Two speakers can be joined as a stereo pair for even more powerful sound, while the Move 2 can be made part of a multi-room audio system for music all over the house if you have other Sonos or Ikea speakers.
The Move 2 supports Amazon’s Alexa and the Sonos voice assistant, the latter of which can control the speaker, processing your requests on the device rather than having to go to a cloud server for rapid responses and improved privacy.
The battery lasts up to 24 hours of playback, which is more than twice the length of the speaker’s predecessor. It also consumes 47% less power when idle, 39% less when actively playing and 33% less when in sleep mode, all of which help prolong its life and save electricity.
The Move 2 is generally repairable by Sonos. The company commits to a minimum of five years software support for feature updates after it stops selling a product but has a track record of much longer, including bug and security fixes for its legacy products. The battery should last for 900 full charge cycles and can be replaced at home, 
costing £79
.
The speaker contains recycled plastic and is designed with disassembly in mind for repair, refurbishment and recycling. Sonos 
offers trade-in
 and product recycling, and breaks down the speaker’s environmental

 and the Ultimate Ears Epicboom costs

.
The Move 2 is an all-round upgrade on one of the best full-sized portable speakers you can buy, improving on every aspect of the original with only one downside: an increased price.
It sounds better with stereo audio and more bass, the battery lasts much longer and it has more modern wifi 6 and good controls while keeping the smart design and durability from its predecessor. It is just at home blasting out the tunes on its dock as it is moved from room to room or out into the garden, sounding good enough to be the only speaker you need.
That makes it quite unlike most portable speakers that don’t sound or work well enough to get used at home. Plus it will get many years of software support and the battery can be replaced for a reasonable sum at home, so it won’t end up in landfill when it wears out, unlike your average Bluetooth speaker.
Still, £449 is a lot for a speaker when the equally excellent Era 100 costs about half that. But if you want a single long lasting, top-quality speaker for anywhere and everywhere in your home, the Sonos Move 2 is hard to beat.",Mon 20 Nov 2023 07.00 GMT,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/20/sonos-move-2-review-sound-battery-life-portable-speaker-bluetooth
Apple MacBook Pro M3 review: beloved laptop is back in black,Samuel Gibbs,"Apple’s latest upgraded MacBook Pro adds a wider range of chip options, a cheaper price and a new black colour option, alongside even greater performance and battery life.
The much-loved laptop now starts at £1,699 (€1,999/$1,599/A$2,699), which isn’t exactly cheap but is £450 less than its predecessor, lowering the barrier to entry significantly.
The outside of the machine has the same great-looking combination of retro and modern design of its predecessor, solidly made from aluminium with a precision worthy of the price. The port selection remains the same, including the very welcome HDMI port and full-size SD card slot.
The screen is still one of the very best on a laptop: sharp, smooth and super bright when working with or viewing HDR content. It is now 20% brighter in general use compared with its predecessor, which was noticeable when working on documents in bright winter sun.
New for 2023 is the space black colour option, which is more of a very dark grey but is about as black as you can make anodised aluminium. It looks great and repels fingerprints better than before. The new colour is limited to the mid- and high-end versions of the machine starting at £2,099 (€2,499/$1,999/A$3,499).

The big new thing is the introduction of Apple’s latest M3 family of chips, which are made at a cutting-edge scale not available to other manufacturers at the moment, boosting performance while lowering power consumption and heat.
The new entry-level 14in MacBook Pro starts with an M3, stepping up to the M3 Pro and M3 Max for greater performance needs.
The M3 chip is about 20% faster than the 
M2 chip used in the MacBook Air
 and other machines and about 40% faster than the 
original M1 chips from 2020
. The base model can output to a single external monitor and ships with only 8GB of memory, which is likely to be perfectly fine for now but may become a limiting factor in the future. Doubling the memory costs £200 and cannot be done after the fact.
Those that require more power, additional ports and multiple external monitors can upgrade to the M3 Pro chip, which can easily handle demanding tasks and will probably be the most suitable option for those using the MacBook Pro for working purposes. The M3 Max chip sits at the top of the pile, offering a tremendous amount of performance in a laptop, which will be overkill for most, although very welcome by those looking for workstation-level power and who are willing to pay big money for it.
All of Apple’s M3 chips are at least as powerful as their Intel equivalents in PCs and offer healthy performance increases on three- to five-year-old Macs. But Apple’s biggest advantage is in power efficiency, which allows double or more the battery life of rivals and the ability to sustain peak performance when not plugged into the wall, unlike competitors.
Even the most powerful M3 Max-equipped model, as tested, will manage about 16 hours of productive office work, such as word processing, browsing, note taking and working with spreadsheets. That is more than an hour longer than last year’s model and about double that of most competitors. M3 models should last about 20 hours of similar work with the M3 Pro models somewhere in the middle.
The battery life shrinks when the chips are pushed with much more demanding tasks, but you should still get about 12 hours of photo editing or similar on a charge. It takes about 90 minutes to fully charge the battery with the included 96W adaptor, hitting 50% in about 30 minutes.
The MacBook Pro is made of 32% recycled materials, including aluminium, rare earth elements, tin, gold and plastic. Apple breaks down the computer’s 
environmental impact in its report
.
The computer is 
generally repairable
 and has 
repair manuals available
, and the battery can be replaced for £245 by Apple. The repair specialists iFixit praised the machine’s modular design but 
criticised Apple’s use of software locks
 on replacement parts that artificially limit third-party repair options, giving it a repairability score of only four out of 10. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.
The 14in MacBook Pro starts at 
£1,699
 (€1,999/
$1,599
/
A$2,699
) for an M3 chip with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Models with the M3 Pro cost from £2,099, while M3 Max models start at £3,299.
For comparison, the 
MacBook Air M2
 starts at 
£1,149
, while Windows laptops roughly equivalent to the new machines, such as the Dell XPS 15, cost about 
£2,000
, the Razer Blade 14 costs 
£2,499
 and 
Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio 2
 costs from 
£2,069
.
There are more options than ever for Apple’s longstanding Pro laptop this year. The lower starting price is most welcome, although it is still not cheap at £1,699 and comes with a chip that while tremendously fast, may not be powerful enough for professional work and only 8GB of memory.
That makes the base model difficult to recommend over the 
excellent MacBook Air
 for Apple users. Not so for the M3 Pro and Max models, which are yet again a remarkable combination of power and efficiency that no other manufacturer can touch. Here Apple continues to go from strength to strength.
The 14in size remains the sweet spot in laptops, which is helped by a stunning screen, best-in-class trackpad and keyboard, and a solid selection of ports. It’s not cheap but if you don’t specifically need Windows 11, it is one of the very best working laptops you can buy. And it looks pretty great in black.",Mon 11 Dec 2023 07.00 GMT,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/11/apple-macbook-pro-m3-review-beloved-laptop-is-back-in-black-battery-screen
Fairphone 5 review: could this be the first phone to last 10 years?,Samuel Gibbs,"The Dutch smartphone company Fairphone has achieved something remarkable – a handset that could last a decade.
The ethical pioneer, which leads the way in repairable devices, has just released the Fairphone 5. It is a thinner, lighter and more refined device compared with its predecessors and one that makes leaps and bounds in terms of longevity, repairability and quality.
With a £649 (€699) price tag, it is more expensive than 
those before it
 but it offers up to 10 years of software support – unheard of in the smartphone industry and a significant step in addressing tech waste.
The most noticeable upgrade in the new device is the screen, now a crisp OLED running at 90Hz for smooth scrolling and bright enough for most situations, though it struggles a bit in bright sunlight.
The device feels solid and durable but looks a little dated compared with the most modern designs. It has IP55 water resistance, which means it can handle rain, spray or splashes just fine but not drops into a swimming pool.
The stereo speakers are fine but cannot match an iPhone or Samsung. The vibration motor is fairly strong but sounds a bit hollow for keyboard taps and alerts. Call quality is good and you can use a nano and e-sim at the same time for two lines in one phone.

The latest Fairphone has an unusual chip at its heart. The Qualcomm 
QCM6490
 is designed primarily for a wide range of commercial systems, not phones, but works just as well in the Fairphone, with roughly the same performance as a mid-range Snapdragon 782 phone chip from last year.
That means it won’t win any performance awards but it is faster than its predecessor, feels snappy for daily tasks and is capable of mild gaming. Its big advantage is long-term support, enabling at least five Android version updates and eight years of security updates, with Fairphone intending to stretch that to a full 10 years from release – something no other manufacturer offers, the best maxing out at about six to seven years.
The Fairphone also has a microSD card slot so you can easily and cheaply add storage.
Battery life is middle of the road, lasting about 36 hours between charges, including actively using the screen for more than five hours at 90Hz (the faster of two available speeds) and two hours spent on 5G. That means it will generally need charging every night or every other day for lighter usage.
The battery takes 66 minutes to fully recharge using a 30W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting 50% in 21 minutes. However, you can also swap the battery out in seconds, so it is possible to carry a spare if you need the phone to last longer.
Fairphone says the battery will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for more than 1,000 full-charge cycles and a replacement or spare costs £36.
The Fairphone 5 has a five-year warranty. Users can repair the phone themselves with 
10 modular spare parts
 available, requiring only a standard screwdriver to install. A replacement display costs £90, the back £22, while other components range between £18 and £62.
Fairphone recycles the equivalent weight (212g) of electronics for each phone sold, making it e-waste neutral. It uses 
fair trade gold and silver
, ethically sourced lithium and tungsten, and recycled aluminium, copper, indium, magnesium, nickel, plastic, rare earth elements, tin and zinc. The firm also tops up the pay of its contract manufacturing workers to a living wage.
The phone ships with standard Android 13 without unnecessary added elements, beyond a pre-loaded My Fairphone app for service and support. That means it is pretty fast in operation, but lacks the bells, whistles and extensive customisation options you might get on a Google or Samsung phone. It has full access to the Google Play store and Google’s various services, so it doesn’t want for apps, and should be familiar to anyone who has used an Android device in the last five years.
With eight to 10 years of security updates, you will be able to safely use Android on the Fairphone for longer than any other device. But Fairphone also allows users to install another operating system should they want – such as Linux or other versions of Android – which may appeal to tinkerers or those looking to free themselves from Google services.
The phone has a pair of 50-megapixel cameras on the back and a 50MP selfie camera.
The main camera is the best, shooting reasonable images in good light, but it can sometimes struggle with colour inconsistency compared with rivals. The ultrawide camera is decent but lacks detail, particularly around the edges of photos. Both struggle in low light, producing shots that can be bright enough but blurry and soft on detail.
It is a similar story with the selfie camera, which captures solid images in good light but can be bleached out in bright or backlit conditions and struggles in low light.
The phone has a macro photography mode using the ultrawide camera (which is fun), a pro mode with manual controls, slow mo video up to 240 frames a second and standard video up to 4K at 30 frames a second. But the camera is the weakest area of the Fairphone. It is possible to get good shots with it, but generally it can’t match mainstream rivals with large leads in the software needed to get the best out of the hardware.
The Fairphone 5 costs 
£649
 (€699) and will be in store on 14 September across Europe.
For comparison, the 
Fairphone 4
 costs 
£479
, the 
Nothing Phone 2
 costs

, the 
Google Pixel 7a
 costs 
£449
, the 
Nokia G22
 costs 
£139
 and the 
iPhone 14
 costs 
£849
The Fairphone 5 is another big step forward in addressing the waste of the smartphone industry, with the Dutch outfit showing other manufacturers that long-term support is possible.
Up to 10 years of software updates is simply unheard of, gaining it an extra star. And the Fairphone is simple enough to repair that the hardware should be able to last just as long with an occasional quick and cheap battery swap. It also comes with a five-year warranty and is made with as many recycled and ethically sourced materials as possible. Other than a slightly bulkier design and plastic back, it doesn’t look out of the ordinary.
My main worry is how the chip at the heart of the Fairphone will fare: something that is fine now may be achingly slow in a decade. Only time will tell. The camera is also a weak point. It will be fine for the odd snap but simply cannot match even significantly cheaper mainstream competitors, which have a massive software advantage.
The premium associated with buying the most ethical, repairable and long-lasting phone on the market is roughly £200 compared with direct rivals, which cost in the region of £450. Though if you factor in longevity and the low cost of repairs, the Fairphone is better value.
The Fairphone 5 is an important device and great for those looking to support the company’s ethical and repairable movement, as long as they are prepared accept compromises to do so.",Fri 8 Sep 2023 07.00 BST,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/08/fairphone-5-review-could-this-be-the-first-phone-to-last-10-years
TechScape: ‘Hot garbage’ or core protection? Inside Apple’s ongoing beef with the EU,Alex Hern,"Who owns the phone in your pocket? That’s the question at the heart of Apple’s latest battle with European regulators, and it doesn’t look as if it’s going to be settled any time soon.
On Thursday, the company published its plan for how to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a mammoth piece of legislation that seeks to break up the power of so-called “gatekeepers”: the massive (almost entirely American) technology companies whose stature warps whole industries. 
From our story
:
The six companies named as gatekeepers – the American big five of Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and 
Amazon
, plus ByteDance – have a raft of requirements foisted on them in the areas they are considered to be dominant. Varied though they are, covering everything from TikTok’s power in social networking to Google’s monopoly in search engines, the goal is the same: to ensure that control of the services doesn’t lead to control of the world we build on top of them.
But giving up control is hard. 
Apple
 has long argued that its strict control of the iOS platform and the App Store is fundamentally paternalistic, rather than authoritarian. It says that a world in which iPhones worked like Macs would be one with more scams, viruses and consumer harms. The EU says, effectively: “We’ll take that risk.”
Hence the company’s begrudging new plans. When Apple 
switched the iPhone line to use USB-C
 rather than the company’s own Lightning ports, it was effusive about the benefits the change would bring – and silent about the fact that it was mandated by the EU. Not so this time. Apple’s announcement drips with displeasure at being forced to do something it detests:
A whole new world
So what has changed? A whole lot. Some of the new rules announced last week apply globally, and some in the EU only, which helpfully lets us guess at what things Apple is pissed off at having to change, and what things Apple is absolutely spitting furious about.
In the former category, the company has relaxed its limitations on video game streaming services (such as Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass), and will no longer require each individual game to have its own presence on the App Store. It’s also dropped requirements for apps to support its homegrown “Sign in with Apple” technology (though developers will still have to offer a “privacy-focused” login service, and cannot force people to use, for example, “sign in with Facebook”). Developers will also receive new analytics data, it said.
The latter category is much bigger, much more consequential, and all exclusive to users within the EU. Top of the list is the ability, for the first time, for developers to make their apps available outside the App Store. It’s not a total free-for-all, however: Apple will require apps to be installed from a comparable marketplace, which can only be run by big companies (who can prove they have access to €1m of credit), and must be (as best it can enforce it) “real” marketplaces. In other words, Facebook can run an app store, but not if it only has apps made by Facebook on it.
Apple will still maintain a modicum of control over those app stores, vetting the apps that go on them for security concerns, but explicitly 
not
 applying the company’s content policies. That’s as the EU wants it, but does mean the burden of complying with the vast array of 
other
 European regulations will fall on the third-party marketplaces that spring up.
Equally important is the ability of developers to build their own web browsers and contactless payment systems. Apple has long prevented others from doing that (third-party browsers on iOS, such as Chrome and Firefox, are just wrappers for Apple’s own “WebKit” rendering engine) for security reasons, and now we get to see whether the trade-off was worth it.
Money talks
But let’s not get too stuck on points of principle. The real reason this bevy of announcements is so consequential is money. And that’s where Apple threw a grenade at the status quo.
EU developers will be offered two choices. They can either continue as though nothing has changed, or they can take the “alternative terms”. Those see the cut they pay Apple for downloads from the App Store reduced from its current 15-30% down to 10-17% (depending on the business they’re in), with a 3% surcharge to use Apple’s own payment system. Payments from alternative app stores garner no commission at all (although said stores may charge their own fees).
But these savings don’t come for free. Developers who sign up for the new terms will also need to pay a “core technology fee”, an (effectively) annual €0.50 per user. And that’s where the question of who owns your iPhone comes in.
For the first time, Apple is making explicit an argument it has danced around for a long time: that even though you have bought an iPhone from it, it still deserves to be paid for you to use it. The core technology fee, the company says, “reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ businesses”. (Apple already charges developers $99 a year to build for the platform.)
The fee has sparked outrage from some of the companies that were most hoping for the change, including Epic Games (
who called the new terms
 “hot garbage”) and Spotify (
who called it
 “extortion, plain and simple”).
It certainly upends the economics of app development, rendering free-to-play development extremely risky, and almost certainly increasing the payment many developers would have to make to Apple. Spotify, for instance, doesn’t allow users to subscribe through the App Store, and so currently pays nothing to the company. That would increase to tens of millions of euros a year if it accepted the alternative terms.
And while most apps get their first million users for free, thanks to the beneficence of Apple, alternative app stores have to pay the fee from user one – which means they’ll be economically compelled to impose their own charging structure to avoid haemorrhaging cash.
Where does this leave indie developers?
What follows will almost certainly be an extended period of haggling. Big European tech firms will want the fee to be cut or eliminated altogether. Apple, meanwhile, will want to give no further ground, but more importantly, will want to avoid the appearance of the European experiment being seen to be a success. If few alternative app stores launch, and most developers stick on the pre-existing terms, it will strengthen its claim that other jurisdictions don’t need to follow the EU’s lead. That, more than anything, likely explains the dogged attempt to follow the letter rather than the spirit of the regulations.
Both sides of big tech, then, think that the new terms will have little difference. But I’m not so sure they’re right.
The tech I want to see flourishing isn’t megascale streaming services who need to trim pennies from every monthly user, any more than it is monolithic platforms whose desire for control warps the culture at large. Instead, I’m eager to see a world in which indie developers, artists and creators can coexist with the massive players. Alternative marketplaces, low commissions and flat fees don’t help Spotify in its battle with Apple Music, but could make for a very different landscape for those developers who just need to find a niche within a niche to make their home.",Tue 30 Jan 2024 11.35 GMT,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/30/hot-garbage-or-core-protection-inside-apples-ongoing-beef-with-the-eu
"<h1 class=""dcr-1fasd0d"">Amazon drops $1.4bn deal to buy iRobot after EU veto reports</h1>",Dan Milmo,"Amazon has abandoned its planned $1.4bn (£1.1bn) acquisition of the robot vacuum cleaner company iRobot, amid EU opposition to the deal.
The e-commerce company will pay a $94m break fee to iRobot, which immediately announced plans to axe 31% of its workforce – or 350 employees – and the departure of its chief executive.
The Wall Street Journal reported on 18 January that the EU’s executive arm was preparing to block the acquisition of the Roomba maker and had informed Amazon of its proposed view.
Amazon and iRobot said in a joint statement the takeover had “no path to regulatory approval in the 
European Union
, preventing Amazon and iRobot from moving forward together”.
David Zapolsky, the Amazon general counsel, said: “Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition – the very things that regulators say they’re trying to protect.”
The European Commission formally raised concerns about the deal in November, saying it could restrict competition in the robot vacuum cleaner market. The commission’s concerns included Amazon reducing the visibility of rival vacuum cleaners on its retail platform.
Amazon 
announced the deal in August 2022
. The online retailer, which already owns the Alexa smart speaker and Ring doorbell, was pushing to expand its stable of smart home devices.
The UK competition regulator cleared the takeover in June last year. However, the deal had also been under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the US competition watchdog, which has separately launched a 
sweeping lawsuit 
against the business.
Verity Egerton-Doyle, a partner at UK law firm Linklaters, said Amazon’s refusal to offer concessions in response to the commission’s 
statement of objections
 – a formal list of its concerns – had doomed the deal.
“This was the inevitable outcome after Amazon declined to offer remedies to the European Commission,” she said.
Anne Witt, a professor of antitrust law at EDHEC Business School, said the abandonment of the deal was a “fascinating development” because big tech groups had been able historically to resolve EU concerns about takeovers. For instance, last year the EU approved 
Microsoft’s $69bn takeover
 of video game maker Activision Blizzard.
Witt said the EU’s doubts about the deal echoed some of the concerns about Amazon in the FTC’s wider September lawsuit, which includes allegations that the company prioritises its own products over others.
The Open Markets Institute, which researches the impact of corporate monopolies, said on Monday the commission should be “applauded for standing up to Amazon”.
“Today’s momentous news isn’t just about robot vacuums – it’s about checking the growing power a handful of giants have over our increasingly digital lives, including the devices we use within the four walls of our homes,” said Max von Thun, the OMI’s Europe director.
Colin Angle, the founder of iRobot, who stepped down as chair and chief executive after the news, said the termination of the deal was “disappointing”. He added: “iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better, and that our customers around the world love.”",Mon 29 Jan 2024 14.47 GMT,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/29/amazon-deal-irobot-eu-veto-roomba
Apple iPhone 15 review: a few more pro features each year,Samuel Gibbs,"T
he 
iPhone
 15 continues Apple’s slow trickling down of features previously reserved for its top Pro-line phones to other models. But even with the new dynamic island, improved camera, a faster chip and USB-C, the standard iPhone can’t escape seeming just a little bit boring.
The regular iPhone for 2023 gets a £50 price cut in the UK costing £799 (€949/$799/A$1,499), although other regions aren’t so lucky. That makes it about £200 cheaper than the 
similarly sized iPhone 15 Pro
, with a plus-sized version also available for about £100 more.
The 15 has the same combination of aluminium and glass as the last few years of iPhones. The aluminium edges have been chamfered this year for a softer feel, although only if you don’t put it in a case. The screen is twice as bright as previous models, making it easier to read outdoors, but it lacks the always-on display mode and faster refresh rate for smoother scrolling from the Pro iPhone models and Android competitors of this price.
The six-year-old notch design at the top of the screen that hid the selfie camera and Face ID system has been replaced by the smaller dynamic island, which was first introduced on the 
iPhone 14 Pro last year
. It is useful for showing timers and other bits and easier to ignore when not needed. The mute switch in the side remains for the 15, having been replaced by a button for 
the Pro models this year
.
The phone also has the 14 Pro’s A16 Bionic chip from last year, which is still one of the fastest available and keeps the phone feeling snappy. The battery lasts about the same as the 
iPhone 14
 – up to 48 hours – which is pretty good for a relatively small smartphone in 2023. It means you will need to charge the iPhone 15 about every two days, which takes about 110 minutes from flat using a 20W or greater USB-C power adaptor (not included).
New for this year is the USB-C port, which, like the other iPhones for 2023 means ditching the Lightning cable and any accessories you might have. The benefit is you can charge the iPhone 15 with just about any power adaptor and USB-C cable, including those for laptops, tablets and Android phones, not only 
Apple
 devices. You can also use a host of USB-C accessories, such as game controllers, SD card readers and display cables, although note that the iPhone 15 is limited to the same USB2.0 speeds as previous Lightning-equipped models.

It contains recycled aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, plastic, rare earth elements, tin and tungsten. The company breaks down the

The iPhone 15 has a dual-camera system on the back, which features an improved 48-megapixel main camera plus a 12MP ultrawide similar to last year’s model.
The main camera shoots 24MP images by default, up from 12MP, and produces better-looking and more detailed images across various lighting conditions. It can shoot full 48MP images, which is best done very bright light, and has the 2x optical zoom from last year’s Pro models, which zooms in on the centre of the sensor.
Perhaps a bigger deal is that the main photo mode now automatically captures depth information when it detects people or pets, allowing you refocus the images and turn them into portrait mode shots when editing them after the fact. It also means night mode can be used at the same time for much better portraits in low light.
The lack of an extended optical zoom holds the standard iPhone back, remaining the reserve of the Pro models alongside their more advance photography and videography features. But overall the camera captures good-looking photos without much effort.

 and the

.
For those with older phones from five or so years ago, the iPhone 15 marks a giant leap forward with a fast chip, long battery life, a crisp and bright display and the more useful USB-C port.
The trickle-down effect from the iPhone Pro models also adds a bit of interest. The dynamic island from the 
14 Pro
 certainly improves on the older notch design. The 48MP main camera captures more detail and the automatic portrait mode is a bit of a gamechanger.
But the same regular iPhone caveats apply from previous years. No extended zoom is disappointing, no always-on display or high refresh rate for the screen is a miss and the body colour options are a bit too washed out and pale. None of these things are deal killers, but are features found on competitors of this price.
The iPhone 15 is a good phone. It’s just not as exciting as it should be for the price. For that in an iPhone you need the 
15 Pro

Bose QC Ultra earbuds review: top-class noise cancelling with audio upgrade,Samuel Gibbs,"Bose’s commuter favourite QuietComfort earbuds have been given an upgrade, setting the standard with best-in-class noise cancelling and new immersive audio features.
Costing £300 (€350/$300/A$450) the QC Ultra earbuds are £20 more than the excellent 
QC Earbuds II
 they effectively replace, rubbing shoulders with the best in the business from Sennheiser, Sony and Apple.
Unlike the revamped 
QC Ultra headphones
, the earbuds have only been given a light touch on the outside with a few metallic accents here and there. Otherwise, they look like the Earbuds II: fairly large compared with competitors with flat stalks that point towards your mouth.
The combination of silicone earbud tips and wings provide a comfortable and secure hold in your ear. Each bit comes in different sizes in the box so you can mix and match to get the right size for your ears, with a fit test available in the Bose Music app.
Touch-sensitive controls take care of volume, playback, noise cancelling and sound modes, which work well. The battery life remains the same six hours of noise cancelling as the previous models, with three full charges in the case for up to 24 hours of playback, meaning they compete with some of their best rivals.

 
Water resistance:
 sweat resistant (IPX4)

 
Connectivity:
 
Bluetooth
 5.3 (SBC, AAC, aptX Adaptive)

 
Battery life:
 6 hours (up to 24 hours with case)

Earbud weight:
 6.24g each

 
Charging case dimensions:
 59.4 x 66.3 x 26.7mm

 
Charging case weight:
 59.8g

 
Case charging:
 USB-C


The earbuds have some of the best noise cancelling you can get on any headphones, let alone something as small as a set of earbuds. They match the QC Earbuds II in their ability to dampen unwanted hums and roars as well as the higher tones of keyboard clicks and background chatter.
The “awareness” mode is also very good, sounding fairly natural with an automatic loud-noise reduction system that stops you being deafened by the screech of train wheels and other piercing sounds. The earbuds have the same customisable modes as the Ultra headphones, so you create different combinations of noise-cancelling and sound modes to quickly switch between them.
Call quality is excellent, and able to isolate your voice from background noise very well while sounding fairly natural on both ends of the call.
The earbuds sound good, retaining Bose’s clear and controlled audio processing, which adjusts the balance of the music depending on the volume, helping provide a full audio experience even when listening quietly. They are bass-heavy but have an equaliser in the Bose Music app to adjust things.
With the new immersive or spatial audio mode, the sounds appears to come from speakers placed in a virtual space around you rather than piped straight into your ears. The “still” mode tracks the movement of your head so that it always sounds like the audio is coming from a point fixed ahead of you, adding to the realism. It does a good job of making movies and TV shows more immersive, and works with any brand of phone, computer or tablet – unlike most systems.
The earbuds are also one of the first Bose products to support Google’s instant Bluetooth pairing and Qualcomm’s higher quality 
aptX Adaptive
 audio format, in addition to the standard SBC and AAC formats, which are excellent enhancements for Android or Windows users. Otherwise they are standard Bluetooth 5.3 earbuds and easy to pair with a button on the case. Either earbud can be used on its own, which is handy for calls, but they can only connect to a single device at any one time.
Bose estimates that the batteries will last in excess of 500 full charge cycles but they are not replaceable and the earbuds are not currently repairable, ultimately making them disposable.
Some 
replacement parts
 including ear tips (£15) and a charging case (£90) are available. The earbuds do not contain recycled materials. Bose offers discounts for returning broken products. It does not publish individual product environmental impact reports but does publish 
annual sustainability reports
.
The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds cost 
£299.95

, 
Google Pixel Buds Pro

£199
 and 
Apple AirPods Pro 2

.
The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds continue to set the standard for noise-cancelling earbuds, dampening the unwanted sounds of the outside world better than any other.
They also sound good, have solid battery life, a stable and comfortable fit, and a good case that’s only a little bit bigger than the best.
The Ultra versions get a little more flashy with metallic accents. But the bigger upgrades are new Bluetooth capabilities for Android and immersive audio for all platforms, which makes TVs and movies sound a bit more real, even if it is a bit hit and miss for music. That seems worth an extra £20 the price of the already excellent Earbuds II if you’re looking for a new set, but is certainly not worth upgrading for.
You can get better-sounding earbuds, those with more features for specific platforms and ones that are smaller and more discreet. They are certainly pricey, so shop around, but for silencing the daily commute they are hard to beat.
Despite having spare parts available, they can’t be repaired and the battery can’t be replaced, ultimately making them disposable, 
losing them a star

Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2 review: still unique but should be better,Samuel Gibbs,"M
icrosoft’s latest top-end laptop sticks with its novel screen-flipping form, with upgrades on the inside aimed at keeping up with the powerhouse competition – but these improvements come with a very steep price increase.
The Surface Laptop Studio 2 starts at £2,069 (€2,239/$1999.99/A$3,343) – a £620 increase 
over the outgoing model
. That takes it far away from the normal premium consumer range on which Microsoft has built its Surface reputation, and places it firmly in the creative workstation class of machine typically used by programmers and video and photo editors.
It may have “laptop” in the name, but the Laptop Studio 2 is a bit of a beast, weighing almost 2kg in its top spec – heavier, slightly thicker and made of aluminium rather than the magnesium of its predecessor.
The rest of the machine is very similar to the 
2021-22 model
. The good-looking 14.4in LCD screen is hinged in the middle, allowing it to pull forward to switch between stage, drawing and laptop modes. With the excellent Slim Pen 2 stylus (£120), this flexibility is the machine’s big draw. An additional USB-A port and microSD card slot in the side are appreciated, but the lack of a full-sized SD card slot is a miss in a machine of this size.
The webcam with 
Windows
 Hello face recognition, mics and speakers are great, as are the keyboard and trackpad, even if the front lip of the machine is quite high because of the base’s thickness.

The biggest changes are on the inside of the machine. Microsoft has ditched the choice of Intel processors and is now sticking solely with the 13th-gen Core i7 H-series chip, as seen in the excellent 
Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra
.
It is a powerful laptop chip, but it is to be replaced very soon in Intel’s lineup. The company announced a dramatic shift in design, and potentially performance, with 
14th-generation
 “
Core Ultra
” processors in September. The timing is unfortunate for Microsoft, particularly with a machine of this standard.
There are a choice of graphics options. The starting machine ships with Intel’s low power integrated graphics, with upgrades to Nvidia low-end GeForce RTX 4050 or 4060 costing more, and topping out with an RTX 2000, which is designed for modelling and similar activities rather than video games or editing.
The combination of Intel and Nvidia chips is pretty powerful. When the laptop is switched to its high-performance mode, it will even handle some high-end gaming with the right graphics settings. But the Laptop Studio 2 comes up a little short on raw power compared with the competition, including the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra, Dell’s latest XPS 15, and Apple’s M3 Max MacBook Pro.
One area where the Laptop Studio 2 is decidedly behind its predecessor and key rivals is battery life. The machine lasted only around seven hours of light office work – two hours short of last year’s model, and about half what you would get out of a top-spec 14in MacBook Pro. When pushed with photo and video editing, the figure drops, which means it will be fine for short bursts of creative work on the go, but you will need to bring the charger.
The Windows 11 experience on the Surface is second to none, running smoothly and easily. The look and feel of Windows has been modernised in the last few years, including improved stylus and touch experiences that play to the Laptop Studio 2’s strengths.
The big new addition to Windows this year is 
Microsoft’s AI system, called Copilot
, which is a conversational generative AI assistant that pops up in a vertical bar on the right of the screen. You can ask it questions, search the web and carry out other general assistant activities. But it can also generate text and images, which you can then paste straight into an email, message or document. You have to ensure you check the text/images carefully before sending, as it routinely made mistakes, such as generating a PlayStation joypad in an image of someone playing an Xbox, or putting the wrong facts or figures in text.
It is fun to play with as a tech demo, but all of the processing is done remotely on Microsoft’s servers. Responses take a good 10 seconds or so to process, but then you have to wait for it to type it all out, which can take another minute or so, depending on how long the response is. It takes a similarly long time for image generation, and none of it works without an internet connection.
Currently, Copilot can’t open apps on your computer or change settings such as turning off Bluetooth without having to click a button. And because it generally pulls information from the web when you ask it a question, such as “how to turn off the 120Hz screen to save battery”, it will start telling you how to do it on an iPhone, not the Surface. Copilot certainly has potential, but it will require a lot of work to be an essential, reliable tool.
Microsoft does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery, but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. Battery replacement costs 
£437.88
, and screen repair costs £583.86 out of warranty.
The SSD storage is modular, but Microsoft states that it should only be 
removed by technicians
. The company operates recycling schemes for old machines and publishes a 
company-wide sustainability report
, plus a breakdown of 
each product’s environmental impact
.

£2,069

The Surface Laptop Studio 2 is a good machine stuck in an odd place. It is too expensive for a consumer laptop, and no one should buy the entry-level machine for £2,000.
It also struggles when matched up against rivals, particularly on raw power and battery life – two areas that will be very important to the target audience of developers, photographers, videographers and so-called creators.
It has some advantages, including the fold-forward screen, the best stylus support, an excellent set of speakers, a great keyboard and trackpad. But Microsoft’s lead on the basics here is being eroded by Windows rivals or beaten by Apple, so whether that’s enough to justify the cost, I’m not sure.
The Surface Laptop Studio 2 is a lovely machine, but one that isn’t a firm recommendation except for Microsoft fans or those who really need the folding screen.",Tue 7 Nov 2023 07.00 GMT,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/07/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-2-review-still-unique-but-should-be-better-battery-life
"<h1 class=""dcr-1fasd0d"">Elon Musk says Neuralink has implanted its first brain chip in human</h1>",Alex Hern,"Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of the neurotechnology company Neuralink, has said the first human received an implant from the brain-chip startup and is recovering well.
The surgery is not a surprise: the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had given the company 
clearance in September
 to carry out the first trial of its implant on humans.
“Initial results show promising neuron spike detection,” Musk said in a post on X on Monday, a day after the chip was implanted.
Spikes are activity by neurons, which the National Institute of Health describes as cells that use electrical and chemical signals to send information around the brain and to the body. Musk did not provide further details.
In follow-up tweets sent in between arguing about video games and bantering with far-right influencers, the businessman said the first Neuralink product was called Telepathy.
”It enables control of your phone or computer, and through them almost any device, just by thinking,” he wrote. “Initial users will be those who have lost the use of their limbs. Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer. That is the goal.”
Musk has a long history of bold promises but a spottier record of fulfilling them. In 2016, he wrongly predicted that within two years it would be possible for a Tesla to drive autonomously from New York to Los Angeles. That year he said his SpaceX rocket company would fly to Mars in 2018 – it still has not.
In 2017, Musk suggested Neuralink’s first product would be on the market “in about four years”. However, Tuesday’s news was a “significant milestone” towards that goal, said Anne Vanhoestenberghe, a professor of active implantable medical devices at King’s College London.
“For the brain-computer interface community, we must place this news in the context that while there are many companies working on exciting products, there are only a few other companies who have implanted their devices in humans, so Neuralink has joined a rather small group,” she added.
“I expect Neuralink will want to give the participant time to recover before they start training their system with the participant. We know Elon Musk is very adept at generating publicity for his company, so we may expect announcements as soon as they begin testing, although true success in my mind should be evaluated in the long-term, by how stable the interface is over time, and how much it benefits the participant.”
The startup’s study, Prime, is a trial for its wireless brain-computer interface to evaluate the safety of the implant and surgical robot. Researchers will assess the functionality of the interface, which enables people with quadriplegia to control devices with their thoughts, according to the company’s website. Neuralink and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for further details.
Musk 
replied to a crypto influencer
 on X who quoted him as saying the company would “help in restoration of eyesight” to add that Blindsight was another product Neuralink was working on.
Reuters reported this month that Neuralink was fined for violating US Department of Transportation (DoT) rules regarding the movement of hazardous materials.
During inspections of the company’s facilities in Texas and California in February 2023, DoT investigators found the company had failed to register itself as a transporter of hazardous material, the agency’s records show.
They also found improper packaging of hazardous waste, including Xylene, a flammable liquid that can cause headaches, dizziness, confusion, loss of muscle coordination and death, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Neuralink received FDA clearance last year for its first trial to test the company’s implant in humans, a critical milestone for the startup. Reuters reported in June that the company was valued as high as $5bn, based on private stock trades.
Neuralink announced the implant trial in September. The company said during the study a robot developed by the company would surgically place the implants’ “ultra-fine” threads that helped transmit signals in participants’ brains.",Tue 30 Jan 2024 12.18 GMT,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/29/elon-musk-neuralink-first-human-brain-chip-implant
